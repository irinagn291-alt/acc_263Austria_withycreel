# Craft

**Ship these. They are what made the real apps feel finished.**

- Home **is** the mechanic (canvas, rings, tower, wheel, matrix, dial, board, console). A tab plus a list of records is a clone. Mini-references are mechanics and density only — never type names, layouts, WebView, OneSignal, or betting chrome.
- Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): the App Store product is a native SwiftUI app with a persisted verb on device. A WebView, Safari sheet, site wrapper, or content catalog you could browse on the web is a reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do **not** make a browser into a product.
- One persisted verb on home. Unit-test that verb. A decorative Game / Aura / Circuit / Nest / Sweep tab is filler — do not ship one.
- Every primary list has an empty state: generated art, one headline, one line, one CTA as a **full page** (`frame(maxHeight: .infinity)`). A crumb in a `Spacer` fails.
- Generated art that sits on UI is a **cutout** (real PNG alpha, transparent corners). An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon fails. AppIcon / Splash / CardBackdrop fill the canvas.
- Screens fill the device. Unused flat field, a narrow text column, or a header-plus-void overlay is a fail. Edge-to-edge rows; the writing surface / list / hero uses remaining height. iPad uses the width. Simulator seed shows a **used** product (several cards, several lines of ink), not one stub row.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Chrome lives **inside** the `Button` label with `.contentShape`. Min ~44pt. Rows, chips, cards, tab columns: one target.
- Onboarding Next / Continue / START is bottom, full width — not a 36pt control in the corner.
- Simulator seed only, once, behind a versioned key. Never seed on a device. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed so home is not empty. Seeded home: primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture, not the first frame.
- Background fills the safe area (no white strips). Tab bar sits on the home indicator; lists use `contentMargins(.bottom)`.
- Contact URL on Settings (or Goals). App Review looks for it.
- Health or product advice in the binary needs citations (tappable source links, easy to find). A "not medical advice" line without sources fails App Store 1.4.1. Catalog credit is a tappable source link, not a static OpenFoodFacts label.
- Camera scan (when used): include `.qr`; extract 8–14 digit runs from QR/URL; UPC-A pad; Simulator chips + manual; stop the session on disappear/background.
- Offline: if the product needs a catalog, a local shelf must catch empty/fail search. A spinner forever fails.
- Denied camera (when used) explains the state and routes to Settings. Silent no-op fails.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (when camera is used): the button before `requestAccess` is Continue or Next. "Allow camera" / "Enable camera" / "Grant camera" / bare Allow or Enable on that button is a reject. The system alert is the only Allow.
- Numbers go through `NumberFormatter`. Day edges use `Calendar.current.startOfDay`.
- One haptic on a successful commit, none on navigation.
- VoiceOver labels on every icon-only control. Colour is never the only signal.

**Review screenshots (21AUG App02–09)**

The running app, not `ImageRenderer`. One launch argument, three keys:

- `-ReviewScreen today` — home after onboarding (often a no-op)
- `-ReviewScreen log` — log / statement / planner
- `-ReviewScreen goals` — goals / targets / profile

Read `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` **once**, **after** onboarding is done.
If onboarding is still showing, the hook never fires. The three keys must open
three **different** screens — same frame on today/log/goals is a miss.

Companion (Simulator only):

- Seed one demo day behind a versioned key (`{prefix}.demo.v1`).
- Mark onboarding complete in the same seed so the hook is reachable.
- `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`. Never seed on a device.
- Seed fills the primary surface (four slot posts from the local shelf).
- Seed the happy path: home primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture.

Driver (outside the app): build → install on iPhone and iPad → launch with the
argument → wait until the UI settles → `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`.
Name files `{App}-{today|log|goals}.png`. Pick any available simulator UDID.

**The frame is the product. Rebuild a wrong screen. Do not patch pixels over it.**

- A stranger names the job and the next tap from home. A riddle headline fails.
- Seeded home: primary CTA enabled. Fake tappable cards and axis values as titles fail.
- Home **is** the mechanic, not a list of records. An empty or one-color frame fails.
- Guideline 4.2: native verb on device. A WebView / Safari / browse-only catalog fails. Push, location, and share do not count.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Min ~44pt. `contentShape` on the fill.
- Unused canvas / narrow column — fill with this app's mechanic, not Spacer.
- Empty and onboarding are full pages, CTA at the bottom full width.
- Seed only Simulator + versioned key. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed.
- Background fills the safe area. Contact URL on Settings.

**Family `catch_log`**
- Home: Catch journal. Limits after save, not instead of save.
- Invariant (unit-test this): Always save the catch, then warn if day/season count > SpeciesLimit. Season = calendar year. Store SI (kg, cm).
- Empty: No catches yet. Log the first fish.
- Fake that fails: A photo dump with no remaining-limit math.
- Never: No Tides mini-game. Location denied → Settings copy.

**Mini-ref `ReelLedger`** (`catch_log`)
- Steal: Catch log, kept/released, store kg, monthly weight, photo, CSV, empty water.
- Never: WebView leftover. Not a bag-limit skip — family still warns after save.
- Uniqueness: new home verb, new types, new layout. Do not reskin this ref.
